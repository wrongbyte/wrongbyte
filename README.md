- :mailbox_with_mail: You can contact me at: wrongbyte@pm.me
- :pencil2: I write about random tech stuff (sometimes) on https://dev.to/wrongbyte
- :briefcase: Currently working with fullstack development, using **Rust** and **TypeScript**, with a focus on reliable and scalable event-driven microservices architecture with infrastructure managed through **Terraform**. I also have experience as a backend developer building distributed microservices using **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **RabbitMQ**, implementing custom APIs and services that enhanced operational efficiency across multiple client platforms.
- :thought_balloon: I am also interested in **networking, operating systems, cryptography and security**.
- :sparkles: I learn by doing. Therefore, I'm looking forward to develop and colaborate on exciting projects!
