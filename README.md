- :mailbox_with_mail: You can contact me at: wrongbyte@pm.me
- :pencil2: I write about random tech stuff on https://dev.to/wrongbyte
- :briefcase: Currently working with fullstack development, using **Rust** and **Typescript**.
    - I have also experience as a backend developer focused on microservices using **NodeJS, MongoDB, RabbitMQ**.
- :thought_balloon: I am interested in learning more about programming paradigms, such as OOP and FP. I also intend to study in depth **networking, operating systems, cryptography and security**.
- :sparkles: I learn by doing. Therefore, I'm looking forward to develop and colaborate on exciting projects!
